# file-server

A tiny http file storage system written in Go, support share file and authentication.

In real development environment, file transfer can be an issue, because there are many files need to be transferred from the personal machine to the development machine and vice versa. With file-server deploying as a server, you can manage (download, upload, delete, create folder) the files easily between different computers easily.

## Features

- Friendly UI
- Zero dependencies
- Single executable file
- Upload multiple files one time
- Stream file to server, friendly for uploading large file
- Create folder at the current directory
- Can generate shared download link for a file
- Can specify authentication for custom directories

## Compile

```shell
$ go build -o server
```

Will generate executable file "server" in current directory.

## Examples

Start server on port 8080, root directory is `root/` under the project:

```shell
nohup ./server -p 8080 &
```
> `nohup` detaches the process from the terminal and redirects its output to nohup.out

Start server on port 8080, root directory is /usr/share/doc:

```shell
./server -p 8080 -r /usr/share/doc
```

Start server on port 80 and 443, 80 serves for plain HTTP, 443 serves for HTTPS:

```shell
$ ./server -p 80 -tls-port 443 -ssl-cert ~/tls/server.crt -ssl-key ~/tls/server.key
```

For generating TLS Certificate, please refer to: https://gist.github.com/denji/12b3a568f092ab951456

Http Basic Auth:

- Listen port: 8080
- Require authentication for accessing all files

```shell
./server -p 8080 -auth :admin:adminpw
# or
./server -p 8080 -auth /:admin:adminpw
```

Another complicated example:

- Listen port: 80 & 443
- Requires authentication for url `/abc`
  - username: `user1`, password: `user1pw`

- Requires authentication for url `/aaa/bbb`
  - username: `user2`, password: `user2pw`


```shell
$./server -auth /abc:user1:user1pw -auth /aaa/bbb:user2:user2pw -plain-port 80 -tls-port 443 -ssl-cert ./conf/cert.pem -ssl-key ./conf/cert.key
```

## Usage

```shell
‚ùØ ./server -h                                                                                                                      
Usage of ./server:
  -auth value
        -auth <path:username:password>
        specify user for HTTP Basic Auth
  -max int
        maximum size for single file uploads in MB (default 32)
  -p int
        (alias for -plain-port)
  -plain-port int
        plain http port the server listens on
  -r string
        (alias for -root) (default "root/")
  -root string
        root directory for the file server (default "root/")
  -ssl-cert string
        path to SSL server certificate
  -ssl-key string
        path to SSL private key
  -tls-port int
        tls port the server listens on, will fail if cert or key is not specified
```
